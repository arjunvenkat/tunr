This episode is a delightful and oddly honest and weird conversation about EGO (Pete and Anthony discuss at length their egos and the importance of a performers ego), confidence, voice, persona, weed, traveling first class, likability, and of course sex and God. Plus a bonus track from the unreleased UCB NY CD about, fittingly, bragging. Enjoy you weirdos!! ",1:31:32,1/4/12,http://youmadeitweird.libsyn.com/anthony-jeselnik,Y11,2011,11,N,Doug Benson," One of the funniest, quickest and most pick-up-huggable comedians ever gets super weird with his buddy Pete getting into blackout drinking, being older than he looks, Best Week Ever and the ethical conflict behind doing Last Comic Standing. Plus another standup track from Pete's UCB NY recordings (the never-released standup CD). CRISPY! ",1:29:00,12/21/11,http://youmadeitweird.libsyn.com/doug-benson,Y10,2011,10,N,Alec Sulkin," Fans of Family Guy and people curious about television writing, hilarious tweets and the usual weirdnesses of YMIW are in for a treat: Alec Sulkin is a writer for FG, a huge, hilarious twitter monster and a wonderful guest to delve into sex, God and comedy with. It's definitely crispy. Like, for real. ",1:40:15,12/14/11,http://youmadeitweird.libsyn.com/alec-sulkin,Y9,2011,9,N,Sarah Silverman," Oh man. This is a weird one. Pete asks Sarah Silverman if she ""tells herself she's a good person"" and, I mean, that's in like the first minute. What more weirdness do you want?! How about Sarah talking about losing her virginity. I mean, this is all in under the four minute mark. Or new euphemisms for masturbation. Pete also overshares his virginity story and calls the Old Testament ""your half of the Bible."" God, this is a weird one. This is also the first ep where Pete shares a track from the lost ""UCB Tapes,"" never-before-heard standup recordings from NYC. ",1:36:51,12/7/11,http://youmadeitweird.libsyn.com/sarah-silverman,Y8,2011,8,N,Jim Gaffigan," Pete gets weird with one of his favorite comedians who, amongst other weirdnesses, is a delightful breath of God-believing fresh air.

He shared a ton of them here, as well as a couple of the things that make him incredibly weird. Neal, like past guests, is another brunch buddy and we've recreated the feel one of our many vegan feast chats here for you to enjoy. SO ENJOY. got it, weirdos?

Definitely NSFW, NSFP (playgrounds), NSFDIACWYIL (driving in a car with your in-laws). NSFC (church). It gets super personal, super sexual and mildly sexy. Sex! Also, drugs. Also, loads of laughs with Pete's good friend and hilarious comedian Moshe Kasher. ",58:46:00,11/15/11,http://youmadeitweird.libsyn.com/moshe-kasher,Y5,2011,5,N,Chelsea Peretti, What's weirder than offending Pete's good friend Chelsea in the first 10 minutes of the podcast? Listen and you'll find out! ,1:14:06,11/8/11,http://youmadeitweird.libsyn.com/chelsea-peretii,Y4,2011,4,N,Dave Coulier," BONUS EPISODE! What's weirder than a long talk with Dave Coulier? Like, for real, anything? Pete and Dave talk about getting-then-losing SNL, what Dave ""pulled down"" for Full House, Muppet Babies, sex, and God. Somehow it was both deep AND filled with the occasional fart noise. Weird.

We get into life-threatening brain surgery, the meaning of life and he makes me feel weird for being a TV writer. But in the best kind of way. ",1:14:44,10/27/11,http://youmadeitweird.libsyn.com/tj-miller,Y1,2011,1,N,Kumail Nanjiani," There's plenty weird about my hilarious friend Kumail Nanjiani to get the show started off right! I've been good friends with Kumail for ten years so we're able to go deep into his comedy (specifically how his early voice was so different from his style now), his marriage (Kumail is one of the few young, married comedians I know) and his thoughts on religion. Buckle up for weirdness! ",1:00:35,10/25/11,http://youmadeitweird.libsyn.com/kumail-nanjiani,Y
