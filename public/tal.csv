It turns out to be pretty banal. People talk about dinner. And the price of the paintings.

It actually makes you feel bad for artists — a group most of us feel no sympathy for whatsoever. After all, it takes years to develop artistic skills; it's intensely competitive; almost no one makes any money doing it; there are jealousies and unfair treatment; and then, if, somehow, your work is recognized and you end up in a museum like the Louvre, you're even treated badly there.

He asked Lee if he could move in with him. Lee said yes, and in Lee's Harlem apartment, Geiger spent a year with many of the great figures of the Harlem renaissance: Langston Hughes, Billy Strayhorn, Richard Wright, Adam Clayton Powell. This is what Geiger ended up doing because of that experience. 

A side note: It turns out there's a movie in which Canada Lee takes a white teenager under his wing and counsels him, as he did for Jack Geiger in real life. The film is called Lost Boundaries. (11 minutes)  Childhood • Housing • Teenagers • Theater

"",84,Harold,"A history of the brief mayoral career of Harold Washington, and its lessons for black and white America, as told by people close to him. Many are activists and politicians: Lu Palmer, Judge Eugene Pincham, Congressman Danny Davis, then-alderman Eugene Sawyer. There are people from his administration — Jackie Grimshaw and Grayson Mitchell — and some reporters who followed his story: Vernon Jarrett, Monroe Anderson, Gary Rivlin, Laura Washington (who became his press secretary). Plus, a few ordinary voters and a political opponent of the late mayor.

Act One continues after the break. (46 minutes)  

Twenty years after Harold's death, we take up the question: has white Chicago changed?

Host Ira Glass reviews how black candidates have fared in white wards since Harold with someone uniquely situated to know: David Axelrod, who was a political advisor to Harold Washington during Washington's second mayoral race and who is also chief political and media advisor to President Barack Obama.

Ira also checks in with Judge Eugene Pincham, ten years after their first interview.

Then, WBEZ Chicago reporter Robert Wildeboer goes out to several wards where Harold Washington did very poorly in the '80s, including one where he got less than one percent of the vote, to find out if a black man ran for mayor today, would the same kinds of things happen.

2000,174,"Birthdays, Anniversaries, and Milestones","The story of Tyler Cassity and how he's trying to remake one of our oldest rituals of commemoration.

Tyler is one of the owners of a cemetery called Hollywood Forever, and he's been introducing 20th-Century technology to American funerals, which haven't changed much since the Civil War. At Hollywood Forever, the cost of a burial includes a video of your life: to be shown at your funeral, to be viewable at kiosks on the cemetery grounds, and to be posted—for eternity—on the Internet. (16 minutes)

Long-time Fresh Air host Terry Gross offers her congratulations... and some words of wisdom to This American Life to help commemorate the show's fifth anniversary. (2 minutes)

2001,175,Babysitting,"We listen in on a ritual that happens in millions of families every week: kids getting dropped off at the babysitters. Six-year-old Dylan and nine-year-old Sarah explain what they can and can't get away with when they have a babysitter. After that, host Ira Glass has a few words about Mary Poppins, who is the Gold Standard of all fictional babysitters. The movie Mary Poppins contains the classic modern song about babysitting. We hear several versions of the song over the course of the program. The first is by Chicago girl punk/pop band, the Dishes. (5 minutes)

Lots of babysitting is done by family members. Hillary Frank reports on what can happen when a teenaged son is put in charge of his younger brothers. It's not pretty. Hillary produces the podcast The Longest Shortest Time, about early parenting.
(14 minutes)

The story of several huge companies that accidentally got put into the babysitting business in a big, big way because of snow on December 26, 1988. Every year on the day after Christmas, divorced kids all over America fly from one parent to the other. In 1988, lots of them got snowed in at O'Hare Airport in Chicago. Susan Burton and her little sister were among them. (9 minutes)

Myron Jones and his sister Carol Bove explain what happened when they were teenagers, and they ended up babysitting children who didn't exist. (25 minutes)

It sponsors the creation of complicated and ultimately toxic financial securities...while at the same time betting against the very securities it helped create. Planet Money's Alex Blumberg teams up with two investigative reporters from ProPublica, Jake Bernstein and Jesse Eisinger, to tell the story. Jake and Jesse pored through thousands of  pages of documents and interviewed dozens of Wall Street Insiders. We bring you the result: A tale of intrigue and questionable behavior, which parallels quite closely the plot of a Mel Brooks musical. (40 minutes)

2011,427,Original Recipe,"The formula for Coca-Cola is one of the most jealously guarded trade secrets in the world. So we were surprised to come across a 1979 newspaper article with what looked like the original recipe for Coke. Talking to historian Mark Pendergrast, author of For God, Country and Coca-Cola, we were even more surprised when we found reasons to believe the recipe is real. (25 minutes)

Want to try and make the ""original recipe"" yourself?

Here's the press release we put out about this story.

Here are photos from the story:


This episode of our show kicked off a wave of international press coverage that, inevitably, included inaccuracies.  



To be clear:  We are not claiming that we have found the recipe used today for Coca-Cola.  We believe we found a recipe that is either the original recipe made by the inventor of Coke, John Pemberton, or a version of Coca-Cola that he made either before or after the product hit the market in 1886.  We believe that because it was found in the notebook of his friend, on a page entitled ""Coco-Cola recipe improved,"" and because it was found in Pemberton's own notebook, in Coca-Cola's archives. 


 
Much of the press about our story takes at face value Coca-Cola's statements that we have not found the recipe for Coke, present or past.  But when asked if the company has actually checked to see if this formula matches the original formula - which archivist Phil Mooney assured me they still have - company spokespeople always politely sidestep the question.  So it seems entirely possible that no one at Coke has checked.  If they'd checked to see if the formulas match, why not say so?



Phil Mooney even admitted something interesting about the recipe in our interview: ""Could it be a precursor? Yeah, absolutely.""  He then went on to express, as his opinion, not as fact: ""Is this the one that went to market? I don't think so.""



Since the original formula is no longer made by Coke, and since all the ingredients seem to be on the public record, why not release the old formula?  This year, Coke's 125th anniversary, would be a great time for it!



So we stand by our story.  We believe the recipe is either the version Pemberton brought to market in 1886, a precursor, or an improved version made after it was already on the market.  As for our bigger point, that the ingredients to Coke's supposedly super-secret formula can be figured out without much trouble by anyone who wants to, that seems incontrovertibly true.  Versions of the recipe have been published starting in the 1960's.  Not to mention that a device called a gas chromatograph can tell a trained scientist the ingredients in coke or any other beverage, not with perfect accuracy, but close enough that you're in the ballpark.  


Jake Halpern tells this story about document expert John Reznikoff, who came into possession of some materials which—if authentic—would change history. Then things got complicated. Jake is the author of several books, including World's End. (32 minutes)

This week's story about Coca-Cola is actually a knockoff of a story by historian Cliff Doerksen about Mince Pie, in which he tells the truly surprising story of how:


To its 19th- and early-20th-century admirers, mince pie was ""unquestionably the monarch of pies,"" ""the great American viand,"" ""an American institution"" and ""as American as the Red Indians."" It was the food expatriates longed for while sojourning abroad. Acquiring an appreciation for it was proof that an immigrant was becoming assimilated. It was the indispensable comfort dish dispatched to American expeditionary forces in World War I to reinforce their morale with the taste of home.


Then he arrives at the magnificent thesis of his article:



Most remarkably, mince pie achieved and maintained its hegemony despite the fact that everyone—including those who loved it—agreed that it reliably caused indigestion, provoked nightmares, and commonly afflicted the overindulgent with disordered thinking, hallucinations, and sometimes death.



In the article Cliff makes two mince pies according to old recipes and is stunned at how much beef fat and sugary crap went into them. In those pre-refrigeration days, that's what kept the meat in the pie from spoiling. He builds the narrative suspense—what will these monstrosities taste like?—before arriving at the story's climactic surprise: they're delicious!  The story won the 2010 prize that's like the Oscars for food writers: the James Beard Award.  It's a completely entertaining, enlightening story, and I tried to talk Cliff into doing the same thing with this Coca-Cola recipe for our show back in December.  Yes, okay, basically I wanted him to rip off his own great story for our benefit.  Then on December 17th, he died unexpectedly at the age of 47.  Doing this story, flying around the country with producer Ben Calhoun, it was hard to stop thinking about what a funny, fascinating job Cliff – a real historian as well as a sharp, witty prose stylist – would've made of it.  He's greatly missed.

2012,472,Our Friend David,"David Rakoff died a week ago, on August 9th. He’d appeared on This American Life 25 times, first in 1996, during the third month of the show; his last appearance was just three weeks ago.  He was on the program so often that in putting together this week’s show, we realized we could tell a lot of his life story, simply through things he said on the show.  So this week we do just that, with excerpts from some of his favorite stories over the years:  

65: Who’s Canadian?
David on how he tried to pass as a local once he moved from Toronto to New York. He claims that there must be a chip in his head — or something like it — that automatically tells him when someone or something famous is Canadian.

116: Poultry Slam 1998
David writes about how his life changed after a single evening spent with 5000 chickens.

241: 20 Acts in 60 Minutes
Working at an advertising agency in Japan in the early ‘80s, David scoffed at their computer “network.”

156: What Remains
David’s first battle with cancer came at age 22. Years later, he wrote about the experience. 

208: Office Politcs
Recalling the years when he worked low-level publishing jobs, David describes the life of a writer who doesn’t actually write.

We hear an excerpt from one of Terry Gross’ interviews with David on Fresh Air, and a never-before-aired story about the Broadway musical Rent.

SONG: ""BLUES FOR BILLIE BASIE"", BEN WEBSTER 



12: Animals
The first time David appeared on our show was in a courtroom radio drama. He played a cat who was also the prosecuting attorney.

470: Show Me The Way
A story David co-wrote and performed with Jonathan Goldstein, originally for the CBC’s Wiretap, about a man who believes he’s turning into a cockroach and reaches out to a famous doctor for advice. Except the doctor will only respond in rhyme. David plays the doctor.

389: Frenemies
David demonstrates — in rhyme — how to make a wedding toast for people you never wanted to see married in the first place. 

The show also includes never-before-heard excerpts from David’s newest book, Love Dishonor, Marry, Die; Cherish, Perish…A Novel by David Rakoff. David recorded these less than two weeks before he died. The book comes out next year. David’s other books are Don’t Get Too Comfortable, Fraud, and Half Empty.

2012,474,Back to School,"

We then turn to the question of what can schools can offer to kids like
Kewauna, and whether non-cognitive skills are something that can be taught.
Paul  discusses research that suggests these kinds of skills can indeed be
learned in a classroom, even with young people, like Kewauna, facing
especially adverse situations, and also the success of various programs that
revolve around early interventions.  Ira reports on a mother and daughter in
Chicago, Barbara and Aniya McDonald, who have been working with a program
designed to help them improve their relationship — and ultimately to put
Aniyah in a strong position to learn non-cognitive skills. (38 1/2 minutes)

We collaborated with American Public Media’s Public Insight Network to find some of the interviewees for this story. Individual stories about how politics have affected personal relationships appear on their website.



A portrait of what it looks like when politics gets polarized, and how hard it is for people in the middle to hang on.  Producer Sarah Koenig explains what happened when a wave of Republican politicians swept to power with a three-to-one majority in 2010. New Hampshire’s a small state, and the shift to a more divisive in-your-face kind of politics happened very quickly, so it’s possible to see exactly what’s gained and lost when that happens.

2012,479,Little War on the Prairie,"John continues the story of the Dakota War of 1862, and how it resulted in the expulsion of the Dakota people from the state of Minnesota. Then John goes back to his hometown to see how this history is being taught today. He speaks with historian Mary Wingerd, author of  North
Country: The Making of Minnesota, about why so many people — including both of them — grew up in Minnesota and heard so little about the war. And he witnesses Dakota people, on the 150th anniversary of the war, crossing the state line and returning to Minnesota. (26 minutes)

2012,480,Animal Sacrifice,"Susan Orlean tells us about the moment America asked untrained household canines to make the ultimate sacrifice: to serve in World War II. Susan talks to Gina Snyder, who remembers being a teenager when her dog Tommy
joined the service. And Susan digs into the national archives to learn the
fate of other dogs that fought on the front lines. A version of this story
appears in Susan’s book Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend. (20 minutes)

2013,500,500!,"Julie Snyder talks about a favorite passage from Sarah Vowell's story in episode 107: Trail of Tears:

Then she talks about Alex Blumberg's interview with Griffin Hansbury in episode 220: Testosterone:

Producer Robyn Semien talks about Ira's interview with Denise Moore, who was trapped in the New Orleans Convention Center after Hurricane Katrina. That interview was in episode 296: After the Flood:

Nancy Updike picked John Hodgman's story about trying to write a screenplay for a movie that already existed, from episode 232: The Real Story:

Then Sarah Koenig talks about Nancy's writing in episode 266: I’m from the Private Sector and I’m Here to Help, about military contractors in Iraq:

Sarah also talks about Josh Bearman's story about his mom and brother, from episode 334: Duty Calls:

And about Ira's interview with Tami Sagher in episode 314: It’s Never Over:



Several producers talked about the first stories they ever heard on the show, before they worked here. Former producer Jonathan Goldstein, now host of WireTap, remembers the prologue to episode 27: The Cruelty of Children:

Then producer Brian Reed talks about the first time he heard the show, when Ira spoke at his college and played a story by Jack Hitt from episode 188: Kid Logic:

Alex Blumberg talks about an early story by Adam Davidson, Alex's current colleague at Planet Money, from episode 94: How To. The story is about Adam trying to figure out how much his life would be worth, if he died in an accident:

At the end of the show, Ira talks about his own favorite episodes. Some of his favorites are also listener favorites, like Notes on Camp, Somewhere In The Arabian Sea, Harper High School Parts One and Two, Switched at Birth, Dr. Gilmer and Mr. Hyde, Starlee Kine's story from Break-Up, The Giant Pool of Money, and the episode about Harold Washington.

But a lot of Ira's favorites are shows he likes for admittedly selfish reasons, when the experience of making the story just meant a lot to him — like the episode we did about David Rakoff after David died, the episode where Ira hung out in Paris with David Sedaris, the one where we tried to recreate the original recipe for Coca-Cola, or when Ira got to go to a Medieval Times restaurant with a noted medieval scholar, or talk with lots and lots of people in Georgia about a small town judge who had been accused of wrongdoing and eventually stepped down. Surprisingly, in the early years the show also helped Ira bond with his mom and dad, who had been skeptical about his choice to go into public radio.

Our 500th episode ends with Julie Snyder talking about the only story that still makes her cry, no matter how many times she hears it, from episode 241: 20 Acts in 60 Minutes:

Once the Fair Housing Act became law in 1968, there was some question about how to implement it and enforce it.  George Romney, the former Republican Governor of Michigan and newly-appointed Secretary of HUD, was a true believer in the need to make the Fair Housing Law a powerful one — a robust attempt to change the course of the nation's racial segregation. Only problem was: President Richard Nixon didn't necessarily see it that way.  With Nikole Hannah-Jones, Nancy Updike continues the story.  (16 minutes)

1995,1,New Beginnings,"Ira talks with Joe Franklin, host of the longest running talk show in television history, to get advice for his new radio show. (6 minutes)

After he goes to Jerusalem and sleeps on what is supposedly the very spot where Jesus was crucified, Kevin Kelly has a revelation: that he should live the next six months as if he would die at the end of them.

It turns out to be pretty banal. People talk about dinner. And the price of the paintings.

It actually makes you feel bad for artists — a group most of us feel no sympathy for whatsoever. After all, it takes years to develop artistic skills; it's intensely competitive; almost no one makes any money doing it; there are jealousies and unfair treatment; and then, if, somehow, your work is recognized and you end up in a museum like the Louvre, you're even treated badly there.

"",75,Kindness of Strangers,"In 1940, Jack Geiger, at the age of fourteen, left his middle-class Jewish home and knocked on the door of a black actor named Canada Lee. He asked Lee if he could move in with him. Lee said yes, and in Lee's Harlem apartment, Geiger spent a year with many of the great figures of the Harlem renaissance: Langston Hughes, Billy Strayhorn, Richard Wright, Adam Clayton Powell. This is what Geiger ended up doing because of that experience. 

A side note: It turns out there's a movie in which Canada Lee takes a white teenager under his wing and counsels him, as he did for Jack Geiger in real life. The film is called Lost Boundaries. (11 minutes)  Childhood • Housing • Teenagers • Theater

"",84,Harold,"A history of the brief mayoral career of Harold Washington, and its lessons for black and white America, as told by people close to him. Many are activists and politicians: Lu Palmer, Judge Eugene Pincham, Congressman Danny Davis, then-alderman Eugene Sawyer. There are people from his administration — Jackie Grimshaw and Grayson Mitchell — and some reporters who followed his story: Vernon Jarrett, Monroe Anderson, Gary Rivlin, Laura Washington (who became his press secretary). Plus, a few ordinary voters and a political opponent of the late mayor.

Act One continues after the break. (46 minutes)  

Twenty years after Harold's death, we take up the question: has white Chicago changed?

Host Ira Glass reviews how black candidates have fared in white wards since Harold with someone uniquely situated to know: David Axelrod, who was a political advisor to Harold Washington during Washington's second mayoral race and who is also chief political and media advisor to President Barack Obama.

Ira also checks in with Judge Eugene Pincham, ten years after their first interview.

Then, WBEZ Chicago reporter Robert Wildeboer goes out to several wards where Harold Washington did very poorly in the '80s, including one where he got less than one percent of the vote, to find out if a black man ran for mayor today, would the same kinds of things happen.
